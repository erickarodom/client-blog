# client-blog
I started this assignment by interviewing my client to get an idea of what she wanted stylistically.
At the end of the meeting I collected the assets supplied by the client and began working.
In order to complete this project I set up my work environment at home, which was a great experience.
Followed all the set up instructions for terminal (cmd) on my pc and went through the git/github set up process.
I first completed my html file and then began working on my css stylesheet.
I chose css possitioining and float to accomplish what I needed to for layout.
In hindsight I would use flexbox instead. There are some issues on the page that I think are caused by the positioning and that
the elements are actually taken out of the flow by using those properties.
Appearance wise, I feel the look of my page is 1998. I would like to say that is intentional but I can't. I have a long way to go and this early process of coding but not having experience or an eye is painful to ones ego.
Saved my work, pushed to Github from home and went through the html preview github process and submitted my first client blog.
